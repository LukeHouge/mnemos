repos:
  # Ruff - Fast Python linter and formatter
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.8.4
    hooks:
      # Run the linter (check only, no auto-fix to avoid conflicts with unstaged changes)
      # Use `just lint-fix` or `just format` manually to fix issues
      - id: ruff
        args: []  # Check only, don't auto-fix
        files: ^backend/app/
      # Run the formatter
      - id: ruff-format
        files: ^backend/app/

  # Pyright - Local hook using project environment
  # Note: Pyright is a read-only type checker and doesn't modify source files.
  # The "files were modified" warning is a pre-commit false positive caused by
  # `uv run` potentially modifying .venv (which is gitignored but still detected).
  #
  # Workaround when committing with unstaged changes:
  #   SKIP=pyright git commit -m "your message"
  - repo: local
